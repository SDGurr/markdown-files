# markdown-files
Holding area for my Markdown files

- Updated .gitignore to include *.PDFs

- Added many updates and adds, most for API1.md and API2.md 

- Added git and markdown cheatsheet MD files along with supporting images.
  - Shit. Misspelled "cheat" on my first commit comment.

- Added "git push" to Git.md.
